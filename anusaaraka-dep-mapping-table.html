That is why there has to be subject verb agreement for the sentence to be grammatical.

	<td> Unlike any other subject, 'there', is the grammatical subject of expletives sentences. It can be seen by the fact that it inverts with the finite auxiliary 'Was there a kid playing in the garden?'. 'There' functions as a place-holder for the logical subject, 'a kid'. In such sentences the logical subject occupies the complement position, hence instead of calling it as a normal subject, we call it 'aBihiwa_subject'.
