Anusaaraka Task:

Goal of Anusaaraka is to create word aligned parallel corpora using following resourses:
1. Anusaaraka output
2. Statistical Machine Translation output.
3. Alignment of Parser output

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Task:

My task focuses on 3rd point.
My goal is to automate the creation of Hindi Treebank using output of phrasal alignment tool.

When the automated and correct hindi treebank is being created it can be used in the following tasks:
1. Creation of Hindi Parser(either by graph based learning or something else)
2. Gold Treebank created from automation and some rules.
3. A system to create automated hindi treebank from english-hindi parallel corpora.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm for automation system:

1. Do projection of relations from english to hindi if and only if
   a. All words eng and hindi words are aligned properly. (Unaligned words ==0)
   b. sentences without Conjunction relation
   c. sentences without prepositional attachment
   d. Parse given by stanford for english sentence is correct.
   
2. If the relation from UD-english are one-many write the rules for appropriate relation.
   (As per the discussion with Soma mam, we can write rules for following relations )
   a. acl
   b. appos
   c. nsugjpass etc.

3. If we have one-one mapping between two relations from UD-english and UD-hindi then mapp such relations.
   a. advmod (BI) -> dep

4. Prepare dictionary for such alignments.
