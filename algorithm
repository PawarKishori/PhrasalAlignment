Anusaaraka Task:

Goal of Anusaaraka is to create word aligned parallel corpora using following resourses:
1. Anusaaraka output
2. Statistical Machine Translation output.
3. Alignment of Parser output

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Task:

My task focuses on 3rd point.
Which will lead to a good nth layer generation.
One of my goals is to automate the creation of Hindi Treebank using output of phrasal alignment tool.

When the automated and correct hindi treebank is being created it can be used in the following tasks:
1. Creation of Hindi Parser(either by graph based learning or something else)
2. Gold Treebank created from automation and some rules.
3. A system to create automated hindi treebank from english-hindi parallel corpora.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm for automation system:

1. Do projection of relations from english to hindi if and only if
   a. E-H translation is very close i.e. All words eng and hindi words are aligned properly. (Unaligned words ==0) (From the data statistically can I check this condition**)
   b. sentences without Conjunction relation (for time being)
   c. sentences without prepositional attachment (for time being)
   d. Parse given by stanford for english sentence is correct.
   
4. Rule Step and/or learning step
   Do analysis and find out the rule 
      if u can find out the rule then do 2.1:
	2.1.
	If the relation from UD-english are one-many write the rules forappropriate relation.
        (As per the discussion, we can write rules for following relations )
        a. acl
	b. appos
	c. nsubjpass
	   etc.
      else do 2.2:
	2.2.
        Collect the different (as many as u can) examples from the corpora and real time (from linguists), then put all the data in structured format the apply some learning technique (like GCNN or something*) and learn the rules from the data instead of learning the data (which many statistical and ml based techniques does)
2. One to one relation mapping from english to hindi
   a. nsubj
   b. nmod 
	etc.
   
3. If we have mapped relations(from mapped relation dictionary**) from one relation name(in english) to the relation name(in hindi) then map such relations.
   a. advmod (BI) -> dep
																																																		
5. Prepare dictionary for such alignments.
   That is why - isiliye

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Number of columns for observations of sentences

01. English sentence
02. Hindi Sentence
03. Sentence id in phrasal alignment tool
04. Algorithm Step 1 Satisfied? 
05. number of interchunk relations in english sentence (ignore intrachunk for timebeing)
06. number of interchunk relations in hindi sentence
07. number of exact mapped relations (algo step 4)
08. list of 7 (algo step 4)
09. number of relations (algo step 3)
10. list of relations (algo step 3)
11. number of relations (algo step 2)
12. list of relations (algo step 2)
13. Rules extracted for the relation (algo step 2.1)
14. Dictionary observations




** work on this point
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update: 2-Dec-2017 : Meeting with Chaitanya Sir and Soma mam.
My ultimate aim is to improve parsers output, both Hindi and English.
So I need to create a better hindi parser too.
How I can do that? - Using Alignment tool developed which uses bootstrapping.
Alignment tool needs output of hindi and english parser. English  parser performs better than hindi parser. So primarily I need to focus on hindi parser first.
Alignment tool needs hindi parser to parse hindi sentences. Till now I was using hindi rule based parser developed by Roja mam. It's latest version was giving multiple relations which I cant use in alignment tool, and it was not that efficient too. So we decided to use Irshad's parser (simple neural network - 90% accuracy claimed) https://bitbucket.org/iscnlp/ which was trained on Hindi Treebank.
hindi_irshad.txt is output of this NNparser ran on hindi_raw.txt
The parser gives output in UD dep relations as well as paninian dep relations.
Sir claim that Paninian dep relations of irshad and us differ at some places.
Todays task - checking the accuracy of irshad's hindi parser (manually, with sir's paninian concept) and checking whether we can use that hindi parser into alignment tool for further bootstrapping.
hindi_irshad.txt    => wrongly annotated dep relations
                    *  Discussion required
