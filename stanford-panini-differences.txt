Changes in Revised for the Stanford Parser v. 3.7.0 in September 2016
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

abbrev was removed as a relation. It is now a particular case of an appos.


attr has been removed as a relation. attr was a relation intended for the complement of a copular verb such as “to be”, “to seem”, “to appear”. Mainly, it was used for WHNP complements. (The relation attr was meant to stand for “attributive” but that was arguably a misuse of the word.)


complm was removed as a relation. It is now a particular case of mark. This follows HPSG-like usage, where the complementizer is a mark on the clause.


discourse was introduced. The lack of a dependency type for interjections was an omission even in the early versions, but it became more essential as we expanded our consideration of informal text types.


goeswith was introduced. It is useful on badly edited text.

infmod was remode as a relation. It has been generalized as a case of vmod.

partmod was remode as a relation. It has been generalized as a case of vmod.

purpcl was removed as a relation. It is now a particular case of an advcl.

rel has been removed as a relation. rel was the relation between the main verb of a relative clause and the head of the Wh-phrase. Now, the converter resolves the grammatical relation (nsubj, dobj, or pobj) for simple cases, and the rest are left unresolved as a dep relation.


vmod has been introduced as a relation generalizing over non-finite verbal modifiers that are participial in form (formerly partmod) or infinitival (formerly infmod).
