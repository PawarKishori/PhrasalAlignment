Anusaaraka is a rule based English-Hindi Machine Translation system, which has integrated various tools to give a machine translation tool.

Bootstrapping using alignment tool.
The goal of this project is to use Alignment tool for bootstrapping, which results in development of Eng-Hin parallel corpora.
We can also improve existing hindi rule based parser by this procedure. So its a cycle. Its a debugging tool. Alignment tool leads to
improve accuracy of various tools used in Anusaaraka including, Hindi parser and a good Hindi parser will help to create an parallel Treebank.

This tool will help to automate the procedure of corpus creation, which is vital in creation of resources, which drastically reduces the human cost as well as time required to create a Treebank.

Alignment tool is a tool which takes following outputs of Anusaaraka and Phrasal as input:
1. Anusaaraka Eng-Hin translation
2. SMT output

And it gives alignment on word, phrase and parser level.

Readme to create phrasal dictionaries and to run phrasal alignment:
###################################################################

Pre-requisite:
############
1. anusaaraka need to be installed.
2. rule based hindi parser need to be installed.
        (Note: git clone anu_resources@10.2.62.172:/home/anu_resources/hindi-parser-repo/create-hindi-parser.git
               set the path in bashrc : export rule_based_parser=<path of hindi parser>)
3. phrase tables (eng-hin and hin-eng)


Note:
(phrasal data available for the following corpuses
        physics                 physics
        social_science          social_science
        crime_and_punishment    crm_pns
        Total_tourism           tourism
        Total_health            health
)

-------------------------
Steps to do first time and second time *
sequence to run run.sh, run_alignment.sh and compile_prog.sh *
-------------------------
Step 1
What run.sh is do?

run.sh takes three arguments:
sh run.sh <phrase-table-en-hi> <phrase-table-hi-en> <corpus_name>
Eg.  sh run.sh phrases_en-hi  phrases_hi-en  physics
Eg.  sh run.sh gyan_nidhi_en_hi_wx gyan_nidhi_hi_en_wx gyan_nidhi

This command takes the phrase table of the corpus created by Phrasal tool and changes this phrase output into dictionary gdbm format.
The gdbm output(gyan_nidhi_en_hi_wx, gyan_nidhi_hi_en_wx) will be saved in /anusaaraka/miscellaneous/SMT/phrasal_alignment


1. cp -r compile_prog.sh  $1 $2  $HOME_anu_test/miscellaneous/SMT/phrasal_alignment/
   when we run phrasal for the first time, the first step we do is copy compile.sh,phrsal tables for eng-hin and hin-eng pairs for a corpus into phrasal_alignment   folder in anusaaraka.

2. cp  HINDI_POS_CHUNKER.tgz  $HOME_anu_test/miscellaneous/
   Then we copy HINDI_POS_CHUNKER.tgz(which was already into phrasal_data) to miscellaneous folder.

3. cd $HOME_anu_test/miscellaneous/
   tar -xvzf HINDI_POS_CHUNKER.tgz
   Extract hindi pos tagger, which we copied into miscellaneous.

4. cd $HOME_anu_test/miscellaneous/HINDI_POS_CHUNKER
   sh compile.sh
   1.1 compile POS chuncker.

5. cd  $HOME_anu_test/miscellaneous/SMT/phrasal_alignment/
   sh compile_prog.sh
   1.1 gcc -o  phrase_gdbm_dict.out  phrase_gdbm_dict.c
       This will create an executable file for creating phrasal_gdbm_dict.

6. if [ "$3" != "" ] ; then
        sh get_phrasal_dic-en-hi.sh $1 $3
        sh get_phrasal_dic-hi-en-en.sh $2 $3
   else
        sh get_phrasal_dic-en-hi.sh $1
        sh get_phrasal_dic-hi-en-en.sh $2
   
    Here, if corpus_name is not mentioned then system uses phrase tables which are NOT corpus specific. This option will be used in case if we dont have phrase tables (output of Phrasal) and we want to run phrasal alignment for the parallel corpora.

----------------------------------------------
What run_alignment.sh do?

sh run_alignment.sh e1 h1 gyan_nidhi
This command is used to run alignment tool on parallel corpus e1 and h1, which also uses gyan_nidhi dictionary (gdbm- created by above run.sh command)

1. Anusaaraka_stanford.sh $1 0 True general onesent > $1_out 2>&1
   This will run Anusaaraka on english sentence and *

2. Anusaaraka_alignment.sh $1 $2 $3 $4 >> $1_out
   This will *
-------------------------------------------------

After that we need to do compilation steps to run alignment data.
1. cd $HOME_anu_test
   Go in anusaaraka directory.
2. git pull
   update the anusaaraka software.
3. shell_scripts/remove_out-files.sh
   remove unnecessary files *
4. shell_scripts/anu_compile.sh
   compile anusaaraka * means exactly what
5. cd $HOME_anu_test/miscellaneous/SMT/MINION/alignment
6. sh minion_compile.sh
   why *
7. cd $HOME_anu_test/miscellaneous/SMT/phrasal_alignment
8. sh compile.sh
   what compiles actually do*
9. cd $rule_based_parser
10. git pull
11. compile.sh
    Update and compile hindi rule based parser.

-----------------------------
After successfully running phrasal/run_* alignment output will be generated in following dir with filename_eng_slign.html file
firefox /home/master/anu_output/e1_eng_align.html

The backend files of phrasal alignment will be in :
cd /home/master/tmp_anu_dir/tmp/gyan_nidhi_e500_tmp/
